    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p>With over 27 years of experience as an education officer in Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges, I have acquired a diverse
    range of teaching experiences. These experiences have equipped me with the
    ability to know the SEC/JC Chinese curriculum in depth and in breadth. I was awarded
    the <em><strong>Inspiring Chinese Language Teachers Award</strong></em> by the <em>Ministry of Education</em> in 2011 for my passion
    and dedication to teaching students.
    My robust foundation in the teaching of the Chinese Language gives me the ability
    to lead my students to academic excellence.</p>
